TA's reference model trained on 30 minutes per epoch, 10 epochs to get convergence, 1 gpu, model was small

we can use an interactive job to log model and data's device, make sure they match.

seems like other groups were implementing some ideas from the papers mentioned in the readme (not JEPA, the other two papers VicReg and Barlow Twins)

don't think any teams have got probing to work.

recurring architecture?
he also mentioned that he might his model's performance as a reference later, or give more hint
